		<p>Howdy! My name is William Tichenor. I am currently a junior studying for a degree in Computer science at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M</a>! I have been passionate about computers and programming from a young age, and have spent much of my youth improving my skillset. I enjoy working with artificial intelligence and databases, and hope to secure a job working with one of these things after graduation. I am also interested in Philosophy, in which I am currently pursuing a minor. I am also an offier in the <a href="https://www.tamutabletop.com/">Texas A&M Tabletop Troupe</a>, and have been a member since Fall 2020. My favorite board games include Betrayal at House on Hill, Blood on the Clocktower, Salem, and Secret Hitler. I was raised in Southlake, Texas, where I graduated from Carroll Senior High School in Spring of 2020. I was the president of their Computer Science club in my senior year, and competed in UIL Computer Science. This summer, I plan to apply for internships to grow my skills and experience in the field, and help to secure a job after graduation. I look forward to gaining more experience, and hopefully gaining some meaningful connections on the way! I partake in several hobbies outside of school, including playing video games, reading books, playing board games, and building computers. My current class schedule consists of CSCE 315; a group project class, CSCE 313; a computer organization class, PHIL 240; a logic class, PHIL 351; a theory of logic class, and CSCE 481; a seminar. These classes are improving my skill at programming, working in a team, logic, and many other skills important to succeed in the industry. I currently live in College Station in order to be closer to my classes and to take them in person. Hopefully I see some of y'all around campus!</p>
